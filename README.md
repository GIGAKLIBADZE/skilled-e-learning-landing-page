- First, I maked mark up of my project with HTML
- Then I added some styles with CSS
- Made responsive design for tablet versions, then for desktop ones
- Added some hover states for interactive elements in desktop version
- Then i started to fix the issues (which were so much) until my projects looked alike the figma design

### What I learned

I learnt lots of things about css while working for this project. Also, I became more skilled at doing responsive design.

### Continued development

I must continue doing more projects about HTML/CSS and responsive design also. Now, I'm going to start study of JavaScript as well.
